		<h1> INTRODUCTION</h1>
		<p>Fernando Alonso Díaz (born 29 July 1981 in Oviedo, Asturias, Spain[1]) 
            is a racing driver who competed in Formula One from 2001 to 2018. Alonso 
            has claimed the World Championship twice making him a Double World Champion, 
            winning the title in 2005 and 2006. He is considered to be one of the finest
             drivers to have graced the sport.
After beginning his Formula One career with Minardi in 2001, Alonso moved to Renault in 2002, 
initially as a test driver before being promoted to full-time race driver in 2003. Within half 
a season, was the sport's youngest polesitter; and the youngest driver to set the fastest lap; 
and at the Hungarian Grand Prix, he became the youngest winner. In 2005, he became the youngest
 World Champion, at the age of 24 years and 58 days, after fending off Kimi Räikkönen, in 2006, the
  youngest double World Champion after a good battle with Michael Schumacher. He moved to McLaren in
   2007, but after a difficult season, Alonso moved back to Renault for two more years without much 
   success, one of his wins was part of the Crashgate scandal. For 2010, he moved to Ferrari,
   where after an initial struggle Alonso nearly won the World Championship. While 2011 disappointed,
    2012 was Alonso's strongest season, however, he was beaten to the title by Sebastian Vettel.
For 2015, Alonso left Ferrari to rejoin McLaren, now with Honda engines.
 Despite McLaren's worst ever start to a season, he insisted he was happy with the move.</p>
