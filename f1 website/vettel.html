		<h1> INTRODUCTION</h1>
		<p>Sebastian Vettel (born 3 July 1987 in Heppenheim, Bergstraße, Hesse, West Germany) 
        is a German Formula One racing driver and a four-time Formula One World Champion, 
    a title which he won for the fourth consecutive time in 2013. He currently drives
     for Aston Martin Racing alongside Lance Stroll, having previously raced for Ferrari, 
 BMW Sauber, Toro Rosso and Red Bull. Vettel made his début in 2007, 
replacing injured Polish driver Robert Kubica at the 2007 United States Grand Prix,
 becoming the first teenager to score a point in F1.
Vettel is currently the holder of numerous records in F1, most notably including 
Youngest Polesitter, Youngest World Champion, Youngest Double World Champion, 
Youngest Triple Word Champion, Youngest Quadruple World Champion and Most 
consecutive victories in consecutive events.
Vettel's first title, 2010, was won at the final race. He had not led the 
championship until the final race, taking the title off Fernando Alonso. 
In 2011, Vettel dominated, winning 11 of the 19 races, and taking his second 
championship with ease. 2012 was a different story, as the RB8 was slow out the blocks, 
but towards the end it came strong. Vettel was able to win four races in a row to successfully 
defend his title from Alonso. For 2013, Vettel strolled to his fourth title after a slow start, 
finishing the season with nine consecutive wins as he broke his 2011 points tally.</p>
